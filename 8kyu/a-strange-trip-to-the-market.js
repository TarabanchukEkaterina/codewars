// A Strange Trip to the Market

// DESCRIPTION:

// You're on your way to the market when you hear beautiful music coming from a nearby street performer. 
// The notes come together like you wouln't believe as the musician puts together patterns of tunes.
// As you wonder what kind of algorithm you could use to shift octaves by 8 pitches or something silly like that,
// it dawns on you that you have been watching the musician for some 10 odd minutes.
// You ask, "how much do people normally tip for something like this?" The artist looks up. "It's always gonna be about tree fiddy."

// It was then that you realize the musician was a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era! The Loch Ness Monster almost tricked you!

// There are only 2 guaranteed ways to tell if you are speaking to The Loch Ness Monster: 
// A) it is a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era; 
// B) it will ask you for tree fiddy.

// Since Nessie is a master of disguise, the only way accurately tell is to look for the phrase "tree fiddy".
// Since you are tired of being grifted by this monster, the time has come to code a solution for finding The Loch Ness Monster.
// Note that the phrase can also be written as "3.50" or "three fifty".
// Your function should return true if you're talking with The Loch Ness Moster, false otherwise.


// SOLUTION:

function isLochNessMonster(s) {
  if (s.includes("tree fiddy") === true || s.includes("3.50") === true || s.includes("three fifty") === true) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
